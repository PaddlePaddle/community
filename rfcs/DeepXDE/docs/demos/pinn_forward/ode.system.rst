A simple ODE system
================

Problem setup
--------------

We will solve a simple ODE system:

.. math:: \frac{dy_1}{dt} = y_2, \qquad \frac{dy_2}{dt} = - y_1, \qquad \text{where} \quad t \in [0,10],

with the initial conditions  

.. math:: y_1(0) = 0, \quad y_2(0) = 1.

The reference solution is :math:`y_1 = \sin(t), \quad y_2 = \cos(t)`.

Implementation
--------------

This description goes through the implementation of a solver for the above ODE system step-by-step.

First, the DeepXDE and NumPy (``np``) modules are imported:

.. code-block:: python

    import deepxde as dde
    import numpy as np

We begin by defining a computational geometry. We can use a built-in class ``TimeDomain`` to define a time domain as follows

.. code-block:: python

    geom = dde.geometry.TimeDomain(0, 10)

Next, we express the ODE system:

.. code-block:: python

    def ode_system(x, y):
        y1, y2 = y[:, 0:1], y[:, 1:]
        dy1_x = dde.grad.jacobian(y, x, i=0)
        dy2_x = dde.grad.jacobian(y, x, i=1)
        return [dy1_x - y2, dy2_x + y1]


The first argument to ``ode_system`` is the network input, i.e., the :math:`t`-coordinate, and here we represent it as ``x``. The second argument to ``ode_system`` is the network output, which is a 2-dimensional vector where the first component(``y[:, 0:1]``) is :math:`y_1` and the second component (``y[:, 1:]``) is :math:`y_2`. 

Next, we consider the initial condition. We need to implement a function, which should return ``True`` for points inside the subdomain and ``False`` for the points outside. In our case, the point :math:`t` of the initial condition is :math:`t = 0`. (Note that because of rounding-off errors, it is often wise to use ``np.isclose`` to test whether two floating point values are equivalent.)

.. code-block:: python

    def boundary(x, on_initial):
        return np.isclose(x[0], 0)

The argument ``x`` to ``boundary`` is the network input and is a :math:`d`-dim vector, where :math:`d` is the dimension and :math:`d=1` in this case. To facilitate the implementation of ``boundary``, a boolean ``on_initial`` is used as the second argument. If the point :math:`t = 0`, then ``on_initial`` is True, otherwise, ``on_initial`` is False. Thus, we can also define ``boundary`` in a simpler way:

.. code-block:: python

    def boundary(_, on_initial):
        return on_initial

Then the initial conditions are specified using the computational domain, initial function and boundary. The argument ``component`` refers to if this IC is for the first component or the second component.

.. code-block:: python

    ic1 = dde.icbc.IC(geom, np.sin, boundary, component=0)
    ic2 = dde.icbc.IC(geom, np.cos, boundary, component=1)
   
Now, we have specified the geometry, ODEs, and initial conditions. Since ``PDE`` is also an ODE solver, we then define the ODE problem as

.. code-block:: python

    data = dde.data.PDE(geom, ode_system, [ic1, ic2], 35, 2, solution=func, num_test=100)

The number 35 is the number of training residual points sampled inside the domain, and the number 2 is the number of training points sampled on the boundary (the left and right endpoints of the time domain in this case). We use 100 points for testing the ODE residual. The argument  ``solution=func`` is the reference solution to compute the error of our solution, and we define it as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def func(x):
        return np.hstack((np.sin(x), np.cos(x)))

Next, we choose the network. Here, we use a fully connected neural network of depth 4 (i.e., 3 hidden layers) and width 50:

.. code-block:: python

    layer_size = [1] + [50] * 3 + [2]
    activation = "tanh"
    initializer = "Glorot uniform"
    net = dde.nn.FNN(layer_size, activation, initializer)

Now, we have the ODE problem and the network. We bulid a ``Model`` and choose the optimizer and learning rate:

.. code-block:: python

    model = dde.Model(data, net)
    model.compile("adam", lr=0.001, metrics=["l2 relative error"])
    
   
We then train the model for 20000 iterations:

.. code-block:: python

    losshistory, train_state = model.train(epochs=20000)
    
We also save and plot the best trained result and loss history.

.. code-block:: python

    dde.saveplot(losshistory, train_state, issave=True, isplot=True)
