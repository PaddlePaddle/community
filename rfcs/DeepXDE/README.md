DeepXDE supports four tensor libraries as backends: TensorFlow 1.x (`tensorflow.compat.v1` in TensorFlow 2.x), TensorFlow 2.x, PyTorch, and JAX (in development). For how to select one, see [Working with different backends](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html#working-with-different-backends).

## Features

DeepXDE has implemented many algorithms as shown above and supports many features:

- enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation.
- **complex domain geometries** without tyranny mesh generation. The primitive geometries are interval, triangle, rectangle, polygon, disk, cuboid, sphere, hypercube, and hypersphere. Other geometries can be constructed as constructive solid geometry (CSG) using three boolean operations: union, difference, and intersection.
- 5 types of **boundary conditions** (BCs): Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, periodic, and a general BC, which can be defined on an arbitrary domain or on a point set.
- different **neural networks**: fully connected neural network (FNN), stacked FNN, residual neural network, (spatio-temporal) multi-scale Fourier feature networks, etc.
- 6 **sampling methods**: uniform, pseudorandom, Latin hypercube sampling, Halton sequence, Hammersley sequence, and Sobol sequence. The training points can keep the same during training or be resampled every certain iterations.
- different **optimizers**: Adam, L-BFGS, etc.
- conveniently **save** the model during training, and **load** a trained model.
- **callbacks** to monitor the internal states and statistics of the model during training: early stopping, etc.
- **uncertainty quantification** using dropout.
- **float32** and **float64**.
- many other useful features: different (weighted) losses, learning rate schedules, metrics, etc.

All the components of DeepXDE are loosely coupled, and thus DeepXDE is well-structured and highly configurable. It is easy to customize DeepXDE to meet new demands.

## Installation

DeepXDE requires one of the following backend-specific dependencies to be installed:

- TensorFlow 1.x: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)>=2.2.0
- TensorFlow 2.x: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)>=2.2.0, [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)>=0.10.0

## The Team

DeepXDE was developed by [Lu Lu](https://lu.seas.upenn.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [George Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) from the summer of 2018 to 2020, supported by [PhILMs](https://www.pnnl.gov/computing/philms). DeepXDE was originally self-hosted in Subversion at Brown University, under the name SciCoNet (Scientific Computing Neural Networks). On Feb 7, 2019, SciCoNet was moved from Subversion to GitHub, renamed to DeepXDE.

DeepXDE is currently maintained by [Lu Lu](https://lu.seas.upenn.edu) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) with major contributions coming from several talented individuals in various forms and means. A non-exhaustive but growing list needs to mention: [Shunyuan Mao](https://github.com/smao-astro), [Zongren Zou](https://github.com/ZongrenZou).
