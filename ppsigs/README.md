PPOCR-SIG (PaddleOCR Special Interest Group) is committed to building a vibrant OCR community, and we welcome developers from all backgrounds to apply OCR to all walks of life in the spirit of open source, thereby improving our production efficiency.

At present, PPOCR-SIG has created PPOCRLabel semi-automatic annotation tools, OCR vertical applications (such as electricity meters), OCR C# deployment, "Dive into OCR" e-book and other classic applications, which have made important contributions to the prosperity of the PaddleOCR community. These projects are contained in the PaddleOCR [Community Project](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.6/doc/doc_ch/thirdparty.md) 🏅️ . Specific PPOCR-SIG sub-direction tasks are presented in PaddleOCR [Community Event](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/issues/4982) 🎁 ,which cover four categories, including documents, code, vertical models, and applications. This event is a leaderboard challenge for OCR community developers. 

You can choose to join PPOCR-SIG by signing up for a the Community Event or [fill in the questionnaire](https://paddle.wjx.cn/vj/hoZnW83.aspx#) to discuss new insights with the group members.

The **PaddlePaddle Experience and Evaluation** is an open source co-contribution activity initiated by the PPSIG Usability, focusing on improving the use experience of the Paddle Paddle Framework. Since the launch of the event in February 2022, the *experience and evaluation team* has focused on the Paddle Paddle Framework documentation (including API documents, guides, etc.), covering vairous fileds such as training, deployment, hardware, distribution, etc., to improve the use experience of Paddle Paddle Framework. Furthermore, we aim to jointly explore a new model of open source collaboration through community cooperation to contribute Paddle Paddle together.
