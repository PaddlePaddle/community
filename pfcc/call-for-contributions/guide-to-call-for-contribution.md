# Guide to Call For Contribution

As an open source project, success of PaddlePaddle is a collective effort by PaddlePaddle community. There are various great ideas being discussed in the community, but many of these ideas have not been implemented due to lack of enough visibility, resources or other reasons. So we want to encourge the community members to go thourgh the following program, to help PaddlePaddle  make these ideas turn into implementations.

### Draft a project idea

Anyone who has some thoughts about imporving PaddlePaddle project, and has discussed with several project contributors, please draft a project idea(usually several sentences), into [Project Ideas Section](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/tree/master/pfcc/call-for-contributions#project-ideas).

### Seeking a mentor

We will seek a mentor in the community who is interested in mentoring this project idea, they are usually senior engineers in PaddlePaddle community, he/she will commit to provide any kinds of help to turn this project idea into real implementation.

### Build a small team

Once the project mentor is ready, we will try to spread this project idea in the community, and build a small team with members interested in this project idea, and setup a communication model, usuasly this is a wechat group, with several online meetings.

### Figure out project scope

Project mentor and the team will work together to figure out project scope, goals, and non-goals, possible technical designs, to clarify the project proposal, and this should be documented in [Call for contributions](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/tree/master/pfcc/call-for-contributions) or [RFCs](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/tree/master/rfcs).

### Implementing

Depends on project size, and influence to other PaddlePaddle components, a deisgn review meeting might be needed to further discuss this project with other community members, they are ususally senior engineers, and have respective knowledge background about different aspects of PaddlePaddle. Once consensus is made among reviewers, mentor and the team will start implementing this project, any kinds of communication with reviewers and the community is welcomed during implemetation.

### Land your PR to codebases

When a PR is ready, Please dont be hesitate on asking other members for review, especially the mentor, and reviewers on abovementioned design review meeting.

### Contribution recognition

Thanks for contributing to PaddlePaddle through this program, this contribution will be recognized on our blog media,  [Contribution Certification](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/blob/master/contributors/certificate-inspection.md), and community events.
