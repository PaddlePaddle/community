# Guide to Call For Contribution

As an open-source project, the success of PaddlePaddle is a collective effort by the PaddlePaddle community. There are various great ideas being discussed in the community, but many of these ideas have not been implemented due to a lack of enough visibility, resources, or other reasons. So we want to encourage the community members to go through the following program, to help PaddlePaddle make these ideas turn into implementations.

### Draft a project idea

Anyone who has some thoughts about improving the PaddlePaddle project, and has discussed it with several project contributors, please draft a project idea(usually several sentences), into [Project Ideas Section](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/tree/master/pfcc/call-for-contributions#project-ideas).

### Seek a mentor

We will seek a mentor in the community who is interested in mentoring this project idea, they are usually senior engineers in the PaddlePaddle community, and he/she will commit to providing any kind of help to turn this project idea into real implementation.

### Build a small team

Once the project mentor is ready, we will spread this project idea in the community, build a small team with members interested in this project idea, and set up a communication model, usually this is a WeChat group, with several online meetings.

### Figure out the project scope

The project mentor and the team will work together to figure out the project scope, goals, non-goals, and possible technical designs, to clarify the project proposal, and this should be documented in [Call for contributions](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/tree/master/pfcc/call-for-contributions) or [RFCs](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/tree/master/rfcs).

### Implementing

Depending on the project size, and influence on other PaddlePaddle components, a design review meeting might be needed to further discuss this project with other community members, they are usually senior engineers, and have respective knowledge backgrounds about different aspects of PaddlePaddle. Once consensus is made among reviewers, the mentor and the team will start implementing this project, and any kind of communication with reviewers and the community is welcomed during implementation.

### Land your PR to codebases

When a PR is ready, Please don't be hesitate on asking other members for review, especially the mentor, and reviewers on the abovementioned design review meeting.

### Contribution recognition

Thanks for contributing to PaddlePaddle through this program, this contribution will be recognized on our blog media,  [Contribution Certification](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/community/blob/master/contributors/certificate-inspection.md), and community events.
